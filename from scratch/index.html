            <p>
                The United States has a robust National Park System, managed by the <a
                    href="https://www.nps.gov/index.htm"> National Park Service (NPS)</a>, which encompasses 433
                different sites in all 50 states and U.S. territories. These iconic locations, often called "America's
                crown jewels," are preserved for their exceptional natural beauty, unique geological features, and
                diverse ecosystems.
                The significance of U.S. national parks lies in their mission to preserve natural and cultural resources
                unimpaired for future generations while also making them available for public enjoyment, education, and
                inspiration. </p>

            <div id="importance"><p>Why are national parks important?</p>
                <ol >
                    <li class="section">Environmental Significance
                        <ul>
                            <li>Biodiversity Sanctuaries: Parks provide protected habitats for a wide assortment of
                                species, including many that are threatened or endangered, allowing their populations to
                                rebound in a safe environment.</li>
                            <li>Ecosystem Services: These lands and waters provide vital "ecosystem services" like clean
                                air and water, protection of watersheds, and reduction of stormwater runoff,
                                contributing to environmental health far beyond their boundaries. </li>
                            <li>Living Laboratories: National parks serve as essential sites for scientific research,
                                allowing scientists to study complex ecosystems and apply that knowledge to broader
                                conservation efforts. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li id="middle">Historical and Cultural Significance
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preserving American History: The National Park System includes over 400 units, many of
                                which are historical parks, battlefields, and cultural sites that commemorate
                                significant persons, events, and activities that shaped the nation. </li>
                            <li>Sites of Reflection and Education: They function as "living museums" and places for
                                quiet reflection, helping the public connect with the past and understand the country's
                                story, including the complex history of their creation and the displacement of
                                Indigenous peoples.</li>
                            <li>Inspiration for the arts: The unique landscapes and historical settings have served as
                                inspiration for countless artists, writers, and filmmakers, becoming a deeply embedded
                                part of the American cultural identity. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li class="section">Economic and Social Benefits
                        <ul>
                            <li>Economic Drivers: Tourism to the parks brings in billions of dollars annually,
                                supporting local economies and jobs, especially in communities surrounding the parks.
                            </li>
                            <li>Health and Wellness: Visiting parks offers significant physical and mental health
                                benefits, including reduced stress, improved physical fitness, and a greater sense of
                                connection to nature.</li>
                            <li>Public Access and Recreation: As public resources, they offer accessible, affordable
                                spaces for recreation like hiking, camping, and wildlife viewing, connecting people with
                                nature and promoting an appreciation for conservation.</li>
